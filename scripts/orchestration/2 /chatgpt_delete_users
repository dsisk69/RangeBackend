Certainly! Here's a PowerShell script that can delete users from a list of usernames:

powershell

# Path to the file containing the list of usernames
$userListFile = "user_list.txt"

# Loop through the list of usernames
Get-Content -Path $userListFile | ForEach-Object {
    $username = $_
    $user = Get-LocalUser -Name $username -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    if ($user -ne $null) {
        Remove-LocalUser -Name $username -Force
        Write-Host "Deleted user: $username"
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "User not found: $username"
    }
}
